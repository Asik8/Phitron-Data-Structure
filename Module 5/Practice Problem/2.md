Three Limitations of array which can be fixed using Linked List:- 
1. it's size cannot be increased after it declared.
2. it stores data in sequencial order in the memory. If any of the memory in sequescial order is not availabe then it could lead a error.
3. In array inserting or deleting an element involves shifting elements to maintain the order, which can take O(n) time. Linked List fixed that problem in efficient way.
